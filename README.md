# SeniorProject

Senior Seminar project for Hamilton College. An implemention of Professor Susan Jarosi's Fantasy Collection.

## Debug Environment Info

1. Use VSCode (not sure if it carries over to Sublime or Atom - you gotta do your own research on that, sorry `:(` ).
2. Install eslint as a package in VSCode.
3. Run `npm install` in command line.
4. From here you should be able to write JavaScript which adheres to Google's style guidelines. Let me (matthewjenkins97) know if this is not the case!
